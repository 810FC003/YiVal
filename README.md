## Introduction
YiVal is an innovative open-source project, rooted in the principles of the Yijing, focused on revolutionizing the end-to-end evaluation process of AI models. We aim to provide comprehensive insights into not only the individual components such as models and prompts but more importantly, the final output produced by their interaction.
