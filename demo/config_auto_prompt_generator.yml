# Variations allow for dynamic content during experiments.
# They are identified by a globally unique name. For example, in your code,
# you might reference a variation by its name, like:
# variation = StringWrapper("hello", 'test_experiment')
# In this config, you would define the variations associated with that name, e.g.
# variations:
#   - name: translate
#     variations:
#       - instantiated_value: "Translate the following to Chinese:"
#         value: "Translate the following to Chinese"
#         value_type: str
#         variation_id: null
#       - instantiated_value: "Translate the following to Spanish:"
#         value: "Translate the following to Spanish"
#         value_type: str
#         variation_id: null
#       - instantiated_value: "Translate the following to German:"
#         value: "Translate the following to German"
