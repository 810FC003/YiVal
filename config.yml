# Variations allow for dynamic content during experiments.
# They are identified by a globally unique name. For example, in your code,
# you might reference a variation by its name, like:
# variation = StringWrapper("hello", 'test_experiment')
# In this config, you would define the variations associated with that name, e.g.
