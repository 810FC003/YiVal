        # Variations allow for dynamic content during experiments.
        # They are identified by a globally unique name. For example, in your code,
        # you might reference a variation by its name, like:
        # variation = StringWrapper("hello", 'test_experiment')
        # In this config, you would define the variations associated with that name.
